    <h1>Welcome to the Paragraph Tag Example</h1>

    <p>This is a simple paragraph. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used to define a block of text or paragraph in an HTML document. It automatically adds space before and after the paragraph.</p>

    HTML paragraphs are block-level elements, which means they always start on a new line, and browsers automatically add some margin (spacing) before and after each paragraph.

    <p>Here's another paragraph to demonstrate how text will be formatted when using multiple paragraphs. Notice how the paragraphs are spaced out, making the content easier to read.</p>

    
    <p>
        This is the first line.<br>
        This is the second line.<br>
        This is the third line.
    </p>

    <p>That concludes our demonstration of the tag in HTML!</p>
